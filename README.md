# ADTopk: All-Dimension Top-k Compression for High-Performance Distributed Training Systems
__ADTopk__  is an all-dimension Top-k sparsification scheme, which selects the largest 𝑘 elements from all dimensions of the gradient in each layer, meaning that each dimension must provide some elements, so as to avoid the dimension missing. Further, __ADTopk__ enables each dimension to perform sorting locally within the elements of the dimension, and thus all dimensions can perform multiple local sortings independently and parallelly, instead of a single global sorting for the entire gradient in each layer. 

On top of __ADTopk__, we further propose an interleaving compression scheme and an efficient threshold estimation algorithm so as to enhance the performance of __ADTopk__. We build a sparsification compression data-parallel DNN training framework and implement a compression library containing state-of-the-art sparsification algorithms.

We also prove the stable convergence of __ADTopk__ distributed SGD theoretically and experimentally. We scale __ADTopk__ by introducing a layer-wise adaptive sparsification compression scheme and a partial staleness gradient compensation scheme to improve the training efficiency of __ADTopk__ in heterogeneous clusters. We build a sparsification compression data-parallel DNN training framework and implement a compression library containing state-of-the-art sparsification compression methods.


# Introduction

This code repository covers:

### ADTopk

- __ADTopk__ with a quantity-based inter-worker buffering method to control the consistency of the gradient type and number buffered by inter-worker during each gradient merging.
- An interleaving compression scheme that accelerates model convergence and an efficient threshold estimation algorithm that reduces the compression overhead.

### State-of-the-art gradient sparsification compression methods.

# Implementation

We use the PyTorch framework and implemented the prototype system of __ADTopk__ based on the [Horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod) framework using NCCL as the communication library. Overview of our system is as follows.

We implement __ADTopk__, which mainly consists of four main modules, an interleaving compression module (i.e., __ADTopk__-i), a threshold estimation sparsification module (i.e., __ADTopk__-t), a communication and aggregation module, a residual gradient error feedback module, and a scalable heterogeneous training module (i.e., __ADTopk__-s).
We also implement an experimental proof module to prove the stable convergence of __ADTopk__ distributed SGD on multiple training tasks.

# Papers
An 11-page conference version of this paper appeared in the _Proceedings of the 33rd International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC2024)_, June 2024.
In this version, we add theoretical proof of __ADTopk__ convergence and scale __ADTopk__ to heterogeneous cluster training. In the experimental part, we rerun more experiments for analysis and discussion.
